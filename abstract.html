<div>Absolute stellar ages are arguably of the most sought after astrophysical quantities. This is especially true for identifiably young stellar systems, where absolute ages provide the only constraint on time-dependent features of star and planet formation. Unfortunately, accurate absolute ages for young stars remain elusive due largely to a necessary reliance on theoretical stellar structure and evolution models. I review the canonical description of early stellar evolution as the quasi-hydrostatic collapse of a homogeneous gas sphere governed by the standard stellar structure equations, and I highlight key evidence challenging this paradigm that prevent accurate estimates of young stellar ages. I also review recent progress incorporating "non-standard" physics such as accretion, rotation, and magnetic fields, which help explain the observed discrepancies. However, I highlight several fundamental limitations about how these processes operate that preclude a coherent understanding about the physics required to accurately predict the properties, and thus ages, of young stars.</div>
