<h1 data-label="442400" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div></div><div>I have included sections title "physical primers" to provide an intuitive foundation to understanding early stellar evolution for upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students, or those curious about what is happening within a young star from a particle perspective. These primers are qualitative descriptions of various physical phenomena as seen through the lens of kinetic theory. While simplified, the descriptions are designed to preserve physical accuracy, at least with the framework of classical physics. The intention is that they only act as a guide to further understanding a full quantitative description of early stellar evolution. Those familiar with the foundations of stellar structure and evolution may skip these sections without loss of continuity.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="455497" class="ltx_title_section">Star Formation / Protostars</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="975903" class="ltx_title_section">Early Stellar Structure and Evolution</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="863645" class="ltx_title_subsection">Physical Primer</h2><div>Imagine compressing a gaseous sphere of radius&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(r_0\)</span>&nbsp;by some infinitesimal amount&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\epsilon\)</span>. As in the case of a collapsing gas cloud, whether the object remains stable against this small perturbation depends on the sound crossing time from the the surface to the core and its relation to the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. If the sound crossing timescale is shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction time, then the sound wave generated at the surface by the small perturbation will effectively inform other regions of the star about the perturbation, at which point the gas pressure will increase in response to steepen the pressure gradient and stabilize the star against further gravitational collapse. Thus, the star momentarily reestablishes hydrostatic equilibrium.&nbsp;</div><div>However, the continued existence of a temperature gradient with the&nbsp;star leads to a net outward flux of energy, which is eventually radiated into empty space. This constant loss of energy causes the gas to cool, decreasing the average velocity (and thus momentum) of the particles leading to a decrease in gas pressure. A decrease in pressure again causes the star to contract slightly, by some small fraction&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\epsilon\)</span>, after which the star will again momentarily reestablish hydrostatic equilibrium. Based on this reasoning, young pre-MS stars are  expected to slowly contract in <i>quasi-hydrostatic</i> equilibrium.</div><div>At each step during the quasi-hydrostatic collapse, the gas pressure gradient must continually increase to balance the  gravitational force, which is constantly increasing as the star collapses. Given that the surface temperature is expected to remain roughly constant throughout this contraction phase, pressures and temperatures throughout the star's interior must continually increase, leading to an increasing degree of ionization throughout the interior. The quasi-hydrostatic contraction proceeds until the core temperature becomes hot enough to completely ionize the primary heavy element constituents, notably iron. Once iron is fully ionized, there is a significant drop in radiative opacity within the core.&nbsp;</div><div><i>MASS ADDITION/REMOVAL ARGUMENTS</i></div><div>This suggests that stars contraction time should be inversely proportional to the initial mass at the end of the protostar&nbsp;</div>
