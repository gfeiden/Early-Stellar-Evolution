<div>The approach to modeling young stars has remained largely unchanged since the advent computers in the mid-twentieth century. The canonical approach is to assume that pre-main-sequence stars are "born" with an initially large radius down and undergo quasi-hydrostatic contraction until they reach the main sequence. Comparing predictions from canonical models of early stellar evolution against observational data of young eclipsing binary systems and young stellar populations shows that canonical models reproduce an number of key observational features. While broadly describing observed features of young stars and stellar populations, observations show that the canonical approach provides an incomplete description of early stellar evolution.&nbsp;It is now clear that canonical models underestimate masses of pre-main-sequence objects by 50%, yield effective temperature dependent ages for young stellar populations, and fail to predict a unique age even for individual objects. </div>
