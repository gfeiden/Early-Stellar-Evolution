General evolutionary trends for stars with masses between the hydrogen fusion limit and 5 Msun. Break stars up into three categories that are largely defined by their structure and evolution throughout the pre-main-sequence. 
\begin
Very-low-mass stars are predicted to remain fully convective, low-mass stars develop a radiative zone at some point during their evolution ending on the main sequence with a radiative core and convective envelope, and intermediate mass stars also develop a radiative interior, but arrive on the main sequence
