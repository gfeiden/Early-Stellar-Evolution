\section{Introduction}
I have included sections title "physical primers" to provide an intuitive foundation to understanding early stellar evolution for upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students, or those curious about what is happening within a young star from a particle perspective. These primers are qualitative descriptions of various physical phenomena as seen through the lens of kinetic theory. While simplified, the descriptions are designed to preserve physical accuracy, at least with the framework of classical physics. The intention is that they only act as a guide to further understanding a full quantitative description of early stellar evolution. Those familiar with the foundations of stellar structure and evolution may skip these sections without loss of continuity.

General note: To avoid confusion and improve readability, acronyms are used sparingly and only for commonly used concepts. A list of acronyms and their definitions
