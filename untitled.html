<div></div><div><b>Abstract</b></div><div>Absolute stellar ages are some of the most sought after astrophysical quantities. This is especially true for identifiably young stellar systems, where absolute ages provide the only constraint on time-dependent features of star and planet formation. Unfortunately, accurate absolute ages for young stars remain elusive due largely to a necessary reliance on theoretical stellar structure and evolution models. I review the canonical description of early stellar evolution as the quasi-hydrostatic collapse of a homogeneous gas sphere governed by the standard stellar structure equations, and I highlight key evidence challenging this paradigm that prevent accurate estimates of young stellar ages. I also review recent progress incorporating ``non-standard'' physics such as accretion, rotation, and magnetic fields, which help explain the observed discrepancies. However, I highlight several fundamental limitations about how these processes operate that preclude a coherent understanding about the physics required to accurately predict the properties, and thus ages, of young stars.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="598509" class="ltx_title_section">Protostellar Evolution</h1><div><div>Discussion of protostellar evolution, including a simple picture (gravitational collapse mediated by thermal pressure), evidence for/against the simple picture, and potential (re: likely) complications.</div></div><h2 data-label="673916" class="ltx_title_subsection">Basic Picture</h2><div>In the simplest view, protostars are large balls of gas collapsing under the influence of self-gravity.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="724186" class="ltx_title_subsection">Evidence</h2><div>Looking at how the simple picture compares to observational evidence.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
