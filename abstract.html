<div>The approach to modeling young stars has remained largely unchanged since the advent computers in the mid-twentieth century. The canonical approach is to assume that pre-main-sequence stars are "born" with an initially large radius down and undergo quasi-hydrostatic contraction until they reach the main sequence. Comparing predictions from canonical models of early stellar evolution against observational data of young eclipsing binary systems and young stellar populations shows that canonical models reproduce an number of key observational features. While broadly describing observed features of young stars and stellar populations, observations show that the canonical approach provides an incomplete description of early stellar evolution.&nbsp;It is now clear that canonical models underestimate masses of pre-main-sequence objects by 50%, yield effective temperature dependent ages for young stellar populations, and fail to predict a unique age even for individual objects. These issues are now commonly believed to be the result of uncertainties in model physics and physics entirely missing from early stellar evolution models. Recent efforts incorporating missing physics -- accretion, magnetic fields, rotation -- are starting to reconcile some of the observed disparities, but there are fundamental uncertainties and limitations in model these physics that currently preclude a coherent understanding about their role in early stellar evolution. This review focuses on the development of early stellar evolution models, including modern additions of non-standard physics, and provides suggestions about where theory and observations can advance our present understanding of young stars and improve model predictions of pre-main-sequence objects</div>
