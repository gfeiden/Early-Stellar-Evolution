As in the case of a collapsing gas cloud, whether the object remains stable against this small perturbation depends on the sound crossing time from the the surface to the core and its relation to the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. If the sound crossing timescale is shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction time, then the sound wave generated at the surface by the small perturbation will effectively inform other regions of the star about the perturbation, at which point the gas pressure will increase in response to steepen the pressure gradient and stabilize the star against further gravitational collapse. Thus, the star momentarily reestablishes hydrostatic equilibrium.&nbsp;</div><div>However, the continued existence of a temperature gradient with the&nbsp;star</div>
